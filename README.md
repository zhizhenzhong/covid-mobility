In this repo, we analyze the "Social Distancing Metrics v2.1", which shows the aggregated daily views of USA foot-traffic summarizing movement between census block groups, from SafeGraph (https://docs.safegraph.com/v4.0/docs/social-distancing-metrics)

We use Census Block Group data to get geographical information from United States Department of Agriculture (https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/home/?cid=nrcs143_013697)

The following figures shows the daily mobility change in 7 major US cities before, during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.
